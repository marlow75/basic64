# SIMPLE Microsoft Basic emulator on C64

Simple C64 MS Basic emulator. You can run simple basic and machine code programs.

Emulates:
- 6502 documented ops
- runs PRG files
- keyboard matrix (not all keys)
- CIA timers (jiffis)
- VIC graphics and text modes (bad lines)
- C64 memory layout & banking
- Microsoft BASIC interpreter
- Commodore Kernel ROM

Runs at PAL speed.

In the future
- Sprites, hardware scrolling, VIC interrupts
- better CPU/memory emulation (write cycle)
- simple SID
- full CIA, TOD and serial emulation

Have fun and feel free to grab and modify

Alt+F10 - loads PRG file into memory
